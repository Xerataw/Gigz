## How to contribute ü§ù

### Committing your code

When you want to commit your changes with the command:

```bash
git commit -m "<your_conventional_message>"
```

Those hooks will be triggered over the staged files:

1. ESLinter will perform the linting and the commit will fail if it returns an error.
2. Prettier will automatically format the code inside the files.

The commit linter follows the [conventionnal commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Pull requests

After developing your feature, you will have to push your branch and create a pull request. For the pull request to be accepted and merged to the master branch, those conditions should be fulfilled:

- All the workflows should succeed
  - Dependencies vulnerabilities checker
  - Code vulnerabilities checker
