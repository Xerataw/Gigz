- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

#### Commit linter, code linter and formatter installation

Once the repository is cloned, run the command:
```bash
npm run setup
```

Once the setup is finished, you should be able to run the commands:
```bash
npm run lint
```
```bash
npm run format
```

To locally launch ESLinter or Prettier on both projects when needed.

2. Run command `npm install` or `yarn install`

#### Setup Express (back) project

## How to contribute ü§ù

#### Committing your code

When you want to commit your changes with the command:
```bash
git commit -m "<your_conventional_message>"
```

Those hooks will be triggered over the staged files:
1. ESLinter will perform the linting and the commit will fail if it returns an error.
2. Prettier will automatically format the code inside the files.

The commit linter follows the [conventionnal commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### Pull requests

After developing your feature, you will have to push your branch and create a pull request. For the pull request to be accepted and merged to the master branch, those conditions should be fulfilled:

- All the workflows should succeed
    - Dependencies vulnerabilities checker
    - Code vulnerabilities checker
- At least one reviewer should approve the pull request
